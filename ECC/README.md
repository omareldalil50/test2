Movivation
----------

In the information age, cryptography is the basis for establishing privacy and security for people. Elliptic curve cryptography is one of those technologies. The aim of this project is to help providing a better understanding about this technology by plotting the points an elliptic curve consits of. Further the process of adding points is visualized.

As an educational project, *eccplot* is not intended to provide applied cryptography for productive use cases.

The technology stack used consists of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/).

Roadmap
-------

* Implement k-multiplication
* Show the calculations inside a status bar
